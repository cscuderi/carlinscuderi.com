  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>My name is Carlin; I'm a web developer and designer with a passion for building accessible, engaging web experiences.</p>
  <p>I believe in small details. Technology and the way people interact with it is an extremely important part of our lives. Learning about patterns, conventions, behaviours and how to create a positive experience for a wide audience is essential. I like to design and build things that other people will really enjoy using, and pass what I've learned on to help others do the same.</p>
  <p> I'm currently available on a part-time basis for consultation, freelance contracts, and collaboration.</p>

  <h2>Tech</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript</li>
    <li>Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch</li>
    <li>InVision, Zeplin</li>
    <li>Emphasis on accessibility, inclusiveness, and universal design</li>
    <li>Desire to educate and help others</li>
  </ul>
