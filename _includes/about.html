    <p>I'm a passionate web developer and designer. For the past several years I've been designing and building websites for small, medium and large businesses. It's fun and challenging, and I absolutely love what I do.</p>

    <p>Technology and the way people interact with it is an extremely important part of our lives. Learning about patterns, conventions, behaviours and how to create a positive experience for a wide audience is essential. I like to design and build things other people will enjoy using, and pass on what I've learned to help others do the same.</p>
