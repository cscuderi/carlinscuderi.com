<img src="" data-src="{{ 'assets/images/work/castle-image-full.svg' }}" alt="Line illustration of a castle on a hilltop. It's bright and colourful, with relaxing gradients.">

<p>Designing for yourself is hard! Pairing my graphic and web design background, I created a colourful, medieval themed castle as part of a previous iteration of my website. It didn't make the final cut, but I still like how the castle illustration turned out. This was designed entirely within Adobe Illustrator.</p>
