<p>One of the more recent projects our front-end team undertook while at London Life was to rebuild the GLC Asset Management Group Ltd. website. At this point, our AEM component library was beginning to mature so we were able to stretch a little bit and evaluate some newer technology. We ended up re-factoring several site components in Vue.js, including the site search and a <a href="https://www.glc-amgroup.com/news-insights/market-outlooks-insights/podcast--q3-in-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom audio player component</a> which I built.</p>

<img src="" data-src="{{ 'assets/images/work/glc-image-2.svg' }}" alt="Audio player design. A short snippet of the code running the component is also visible.">

<p>The Visual Design team wanted a specific style for the audio player which wasn't possible using the default HTML &lt;audio&gt; component. So, I built the new component on top of the existing audio element using other HTML elements such as ranges and buttons. It was important to use these elements because they come with good accessibility out-of-the-box. </p>
