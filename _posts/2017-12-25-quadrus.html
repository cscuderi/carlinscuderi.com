<p>Leading a team of five front-end developers, we developed a brand new responsive website for the Quadrus business team. In order to deliver a clean and modern look for the site, we worked closely with other internal Digital Services teams such as user experience, visual design, and project managers as well as the Quadrus business group.</p>

<p>As part of this project, I re-factored our Sass stylesheets to make working on future projects much quicker and more efficient. First, I separated base, brand-free styles from the existing styles. This left us with the distilled essences of all our components and basic site styling. Then, I modified the existing project's stylesheet to first inherit these shared base-styles and then modify them for the brand's needs. This approach was adopted for all sites moving forward. Executing our styles this way has made it faster to build new sites and has saved us a lot of copy and pasting.</p>
