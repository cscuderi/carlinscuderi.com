<p>While working at London Life, I lead a team of five front-end developers that built a brand new responsive website for the Quadrus business team. We worked closely with internal teams such as user experience, visual design, project managers, and the Quadrus business group to help deliver a clean new look for their site.</p>

<p>Some neat features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two unique "sides" to the site, with different content and different target groups.</li>
  <li>A responsive, component based approach to development</li>
  <li>Dynamic "Find an investment representative" form</li>
</ul>
