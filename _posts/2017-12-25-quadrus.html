<p>Leading a team of five front-end developers, we developed a brand new responsive website for the Quadrus business team. We worked closely with internal teams such as user experience, visual design, project managers, and the Quadrus business group to help deliver a clean new look for their site.</p>

<p>As part of this project, I re-factored our Sass stylesheets to make working on future projects much quicker and more efficient. First, I separated base, brand-free styles from the existing styles. This left us with the distilled essences of all our components, and basic site styling. Then, I modified the existing project's stylesheet to first inherit these shared base-styles and then modify them for the brand's needs. This approach was then adopted for all sites moving forward. Doing our styles this way has made it much faster to build new sites and saved us a lot of copy and pasting.</p>
