<p>As one of the first major projects our front-end team undertook while at London Life, we built the London Life website from the ground-up on the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) platform. Like other projects, our team worked closely with our other internal Digital Services teams like user experience, content authoring, visual design, and project management.</p>

<p>Since the London Life site was our team's first major project built in Adobe Experience Manager, we carefully considered all aspects of authoring in AEM &ndash; putting our content authoring team first wherever possible. The result of this approach was well received by the organization and was used as a benchmark for building future components on our sites.</p>
