<p>As one of the first major projects our front-end team undertook while at London Life, we built the London Life website from the ground-up on the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) platform. Like other projects, our team worked closely with our other internal teams like User Experience, Content Authoring, Visual Design, and Project Management.</p>

<p>Since the London Life site was our team's first major project built in Adobe Experience Manager, we carefully considered all aspects of authoring in AEM &ndash; putting our content authoring team first wherever possible. The result of this approach was well received by the organization and was used as the measuring stick for building future components on our sites.</p>
